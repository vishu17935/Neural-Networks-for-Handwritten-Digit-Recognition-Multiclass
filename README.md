# Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Multiclass
Concepts Used:


Neural Network Architecture:

Sequential model with dense layers of varying sizes and activations.
Softmax Function:

Custom implementation (my_softmax) and TensorFlow's built-in (tf.nn.softmax).
Loss Function:
Sparse categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification.

Optimization:
Adam optimizer for training the neural network.

Data Handling:
Loading and preprocessing dataset for image classification.

Visualization:
Displaying images using matplotlib.

Libraries Used:

NumPy: For array operations.
TensorFlow / Keras: Deep learning framework for model building and training.


File Structure:
Organized around model definition, training, and visualization.
Instructions on dataset handling and model execution.
